# Automated-Data-backup-and-recovery
The Automated Data Backup and Recovery System is a comprehensive software solution
designed to automate the process of regularly backing up data to a remote location and
enabling easy recovery in case of data loss or corruption. This project leverages Python
for scheduling backups, handling data compression, and generating reports, while Bash
scripts manage data transfer and storage. Additionally, Makefiles automate tasks, and
Matplotlib is used for data visualization.
